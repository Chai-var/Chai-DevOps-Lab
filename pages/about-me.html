        <p>
          I'm <strong>Chaitra S</strong>, a DevOps Engineer with over 3.5 years of experience automating, orchestrating, and securing deployments across cloud and hybrid infrastructures. I specialize in designing CI/CD pipelines, managing infrastructure as code, and scaling secure delivery environments with tools like GitHub Actions, Terraform, Jenkins, Kubernetes, and Ansible.
        </p>

        <p>
          I see DevOps not as a role, but as a cosmic alignment of principles—where automation is the gravity holding systems together. I believe in deep conceptual understanding over fleeting tool mastery. While the cloud may change shapes like galaxies in motion, the constants—like scalable design, audit-ready processes, and secure-by-default deployments—anchor my work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether provisioning infrastructure or scripting deployment gates, my goal is to convert abstract chaos into structured harmony, much like the formation of stars from interstellar dust. In every workflow, every repo, every playbook—I prioritize clarity, repeatability, and resilience.
        </p>

        <p>
          This portfolio is a snapshot of that journey—through systems, codebases, clouds, and concepts.
